My name is Tanisha, but my friends call me Rose.
I'm a student at Towson University pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Applied Information Technology.
Welcome to my website where I will be telling you a few things about myself. I'll also be talking about 
some of the ways that I organize my life so that I can accomplish my goals and live a healthy, happy life. I hope you enjoy your visit here and learn 
a few things.

<h5><blockquote>
"Did you hear about the rose that grew
from a crack in the concrete?
Proving nature's law is wrong it
learned to walk with out having feet.

Funny it seems, but by keeping it's dreams,
it learned to breathe fresh air.

Long live the rose that grew from concrete
when no one else ever cared."
<br><br>
The Rose that Grew from Concrete by Tupac Shakur
