<h3><p>
<span class="greeting">Finding</span> ways to organize my life has been essential to accomplishing my goals, being more productive and
using my time effectively. Building a great toolbox of healthy habits and routines 
has kept me more focused and less stressed.

<h2><table border="5"> 
     <tr><th>Here are some  awesome ways that I organize my life:</th></tr>
     <tr><td>Make a weekly and daily to-do list.
	 There are many ways to write out your to do list with all the technology of today but
	 for me the easiest and most effective way is good old-fashioned  notepad and pen.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Weekly huddles with my mentor or an accountability partner.
	 I find that having someone I trust know my goals makes me want to stick to them more. I 
	 meet with my mentor once on Monday to set goals and once on Friday to follow up and celebrate
     my accomplishment.	</td></tr> 
	 <tr><td>Use calendar applications and make deadlines.
	 I use the calendar on my phone, a work calendar and also a magnetic calendar. I keep everything 
	 synced to maximize my ability to manage my time.</td></tr>
	 <tr><td>Keep a master list of my goals.
	 I use a magnetic dry erase board to write my short-term and long-term goals. This helps with 
	 always having a visual of the things I want to accomplish so I don't procrastinate as much.</td></tr>
	 <tr><td>Keep a book of action plans.
	 I keep a notebook with tabbed sections for each area of my life. I write action plans so that
	 I always have things to choose from and work on during any given week.</td></tr>
	 <tr><td>Keep important files in a filing cabinet and copies on a personal cloud drive.
	 This helps with always having my documents accessible when needed.</td></tr>
	 <tr><td>Use the organization features in my email client.</td></tr>
	 <tr><td>Delegate simple tasks so that I can focus on the more complex ones.</td></tr>
	 <tr><td>Meal Planning</td></tr>
	 <tr><td>Declutter at least biweekly.</td></tr>
	 <tr><td>Write a three month budget. Use tracking tools to stay on course</td></tr>
	 <tr><td>Start tasks early and prioritize only the things that will make the biggest impact.</td></tr>
	 <tr><td>Most importantly I maintain a good balance between all areas of my life so I don't overwhelm myself.</td></tr>
